Generating Certificates for your Website
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to generate SSL/TLS certificates for your website using Certbot. Certbot is a command-line tool that automates the process of obtaining and installing certificates from Let's Encrypt, a free and open certificate authority.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following:

A laptop or computer with command-line access.
A website that is already online and accessible over HTTP (port 80).
SSH access to the server hosting your website.
Sudo privileges on the server.
If you don't meet these requirements, some hosting providers offer automated HTTPS setup, so you might want to check if your provider supports that. Alternatively, you can refer to the documentation specific to your hosting environment.

SSH into the Server
First, SSH into the server running your HTTP website using a user account with sudo privileges. You can use the following command from your local machine's terminal:

css
Copy code
ssh username@your-server-ip
Replace username with your server's username and your-server-ip with the IP address or domain name of your server.

Install Snapd
To use Certbot with the snap package manager, you need to install snapd on your server. Follow the instructions specific to your server's operating system:

Visit snapcraft's website for detailed installation instructions.
Install snapd by following the provided instructions.
Ensure that your version of snapd is up to date by executing the following command:

Copy code
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
Remove Previous Certbot Installations
If you have any Certbot packages installed using your operating system's package manager (e.g., apt, dnf, yum), it is recommended to remove them. This ensures that the Certbot snap package is used instead. Use the appropriate command for your operating system:

Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get remove certbot
Fedora: sudo dnf remove certbot
CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum remove certbot
Install Certbot
To install Certbot using the snap package, run the following command:

css
Copy code
sudo snap install --classic certbot
This command installs Certbot on your server.

Prepare the Certbot Command
To ensure that the certbot command can be run from anywhere, create a symbolic link:

bash
Copy code
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
This allows you to run Certbot without specifying its full path.

Choose How to Run Certbot
Now you have two options to obtain and install your certificates, depending on whether you want Certbot to automatically configure your web server or if you prefer to make the configuration changes manually.

Option 1: Get and Install Certificates with Automatic Configuration
If you want Certbot to automatically configure your Nginx server and enable HTTPS access in a single step, run the following command:

css
Copy code
sudo certbot --nginx
This command retrieves the certificates and updates your Nginx configuration.

Option 2: Get Certificates Only
If you prefer to manually configure your Nginx server, use the following command to obtain the certificates without making any changes to your Nginx configuration:

css
Copy code
sudo certbot certonly --nginx
This command fetches the certificates but does not modify your web server configuration. You will need to configure your web server to use the obtained certificates manually.

Test Automatic Renewal
Certbot comes with a built-in mechanism to automatically renew your certificates before they expire. To ensure this feature is working correctly, you can
